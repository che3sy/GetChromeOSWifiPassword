How to get wifi password of an enterprise Chromebook in plaintext

1.  Unenroll the Chromebook from enterprise using any method
2.  Activate dev mode and set the root password
    - enter recovery using esc + power + refresh
    - ctrl + d
    - hit enter
    - hit ctrl + d
    - wait for dev mode to install or whatever
    - hit ctrl + d
    - Once you are on the welcome screen, click the enable debugging features and disable rootfs
    - Enter your desired password for root
4. Connect to wifi and re-enroll in the enterprise 
5. You can now use the VT-2 terminal for this session (until it restarts)
6. Enter the terminal(ctrl + alt + â†’ (the one on top of keyboard))
7. Log in
   - login name: root
   - password: whatever you set, default is test0000 (num of zeros can dependend, google model)
8. type ``cd /var/cache/shill``
9. Then type ``ls``
10. You will see two files ending in .profile, the default.profile has all the wifi info
11. type ``cat default.profile | grep Password`` to get wifi password (or any other info on the wifi)
12. IF you don't see any passwords, do ``cat default.profile | grep Passphrase`` and look at the output

If you can connect to the network but not search for anything on google, then you might need to get a certificate for the wifi. 
To do this, find a chromebook that is enrolled and go to settings(in chrome) and search for certificates. Go and download all the server or authority certificates you see. if chrome://policy is unblocked, you could go their and also find the certifiates. 
After this, you can load the CA's on an unblocked Chromebook, and the wifi will work.
